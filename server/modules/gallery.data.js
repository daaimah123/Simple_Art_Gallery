      description: 'The painting depicts a colorful and bustling street scene, likely inspired by her travels around the world. Abad often incorporated elements of her Filipino heritage and global experiences into her art, and this piece is no exception. Through bold colors and energetic brushstrokes, she captures the dynamism and diversity of urban life, challenging the romanticized notion of prosperity and opportunity often associated with city streets. Instead, the title suggests a disillusionment or realization that the reality of urban living may not match one\'s expectations or dreams. Her work invites viewers to reflect on the complexities of urban existence and the disparity between perception and reality.',
